DATA STRUCTURE PORTION
Task: Jill, a project manager on your team comes to you after you’ve been working for a few
weeks. “So far you’ve been doing great work,” she says, “so I’d like to ask you to take on an extra
project. We’ve been having trouble managing software bug requests. Can you start building us
a web application to manage fixes that are requested? We want to manage them in a
first-come-first-serve manner.


What Does The Application Do?

● A user can go to the web application and submit bug requests. The request will include
a short description of the software bug, and a time stamp that should be auto-filled.

● Once the user submits a bug request, it will go into a queue that will serve as a storage
place for those bug requests. You should show the order of the requests in the queue
once the bug request is submitted.

● A programmer should be able to pick a bug to start fixing from the queue. Once a bug
report is picked, it should be removed from the queue.

Bonus: Add priorities to the bug requests. Once a request has been submitted, the request
should be inserted into the right position into the priority queue. The higher the priority, the
more likely the bug is going to be fixed.
